Femme OpenSim organization has been created to host various repositories for the Femme project, an advanced mesh avatar for OpenSim.

The project started with some work an Athena body, rescripting it from scratch. It then evolved to alter some links, and extended to more parts of the avatar, like head and detailed genitals.

Because of long period without time to spend with OpenSim, the project has been sleeping for years, but hopefully, will get back to something usable someday.

For now, repositories are private because things are slow, and as the goal is to ensure a perfectly open sourced project without possibilities to make business from it, there was some fear about theives giving the excuse that the project was dead.
